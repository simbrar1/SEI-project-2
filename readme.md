### Technical Requirements

* Consume a public API â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* Have several components - At least one classical and one functional.
* The app can include a router - with several "pages".
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

### Technologies used

* JavaScript (ES6) / HTML5 / CSS
* React.js (Framework)
* Consumes the OpenTDB via the HTTP client Axios
* Git
* gitHub
* Bulma


### Timeframe

1 1/2 days

## The Approach

Once the API had been chosen we read the documentation in how to receive the data. There are 2 levels for the quiz "easy" and "hard, we decided that we would focus on just retrieving the data for easy, and once that was accomplished then to move onto the hard levels. Each GET request returned 50 questions per each difficulty level therefore we chose to make the quiz out of 10 so there wont be much repetition for frequent users of the quiz.

## Challenges

There were a few challenges that came our way whilst working on the project. The first was to find a public API that would allow us to use the API without a key as we were under a big time crunch.

The second challenge seemed more difficult as we then wanted to create 2 levels of difficulty which was easy or hard.

The last major challenge was to write the logic for when the correct answer is being selected and then for the score to reflect how many answers were correct in total.


## Wins
To finish the project within one and a half days was a complete win as we succeeded in completing the task with a functioning working app. Another win was to ensure that the correct  at the end of the page. This took some
