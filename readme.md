## Overview

This project was to work in a pair to **build a React application** that consumed a **public API**, this project was also known as a Reactathon. This project was made in collaboration with Amy Wilson (github.com/amydaniellewilson).

### Technical Requirements

* Consume a public API – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* Have several components - At least one classical and one functional.
* The app can include a router - with several "pages".
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

### Technologies used

* JavaScript (ES6) / HTML5 / CSS
* JavaScript ES6
* React.js (Framework)
* Consumes the OpenTDB via the HTTP client Axios
* Git
* gitHub
* Bulma


### Timeframe

1 1/2 days

## The Approach

Once the API had been chosen we read the documentation in how to receive the data. There are 2 levels for the quiz "easy" and "hard, we decided that we would focus on just retreaving the data for easy, and once that was accomplished then to move onto the hard levels. Each GET request returned 50 questions per each difficulty level therefore we chose to make the quiz out of 10 so there wont be much repetition for frequent users of the quiz.

## User Journey


Opens with the home page asking the user to start the Quiz
* photo 2
Next the user is asked what difficulty level they would like to do the quiz in. The options are either easy or hard
* photo 3
When playing the game the question will appear on the screen with 4 possible answers at the bottom. The user makes a decision on which answer they think is right and if they are correct their score either increases or stays the same.

The last photo the end of the game final score which is out of 10. There is also another option to play again.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_
